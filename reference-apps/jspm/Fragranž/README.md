Fragranz
========

A reference app for ChocolateChip-UI about perfumes and colognes.


To see this running, you'll need to first run a server instance in this directory. To get a server running, first install the NPM server - http-server:

```
npm i -g http-server
```

Then you can `cd` to the folder and run:

```
http-server
```

This is just a prototype. It's purpose is to show how to use ChocolateChip-UI's views, models, routes, etc. to put an app together. Because this is not a real app, it has no data persistence or actual commercial transaction.
