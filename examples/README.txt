Running these examples
=====================

By default these examples are using the iOS theme. You can change the theme by changing the reference to the stylesheet the example uses. You can switch any of them to iOS

  1. chui-ios.css
  2. chui-android.css

You can run these examples on the following desktop browsers for testing:

  Mac: Safari, Chrome
  Windows: Chrome

There is not really any difference in how both browsers render the themes since they are both Webkit-based.


If you want to make sure your iOS theme is working correctly for iOS devices, it's best to use either the latest Safari or the Safari Technologoy Preview. There is no Chrome browser on iOS. If you're on Windows, then of course Chrome when be good enough.

Regardless of which platform you're target, test on emulator/similator and on real devices so you can catch any problems early.
